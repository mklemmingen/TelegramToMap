# TelegramToMap
Created to quickly look up the location of threats as they come in to judge the need for different alarm reactions (corridors, subways etc.).
Scans incoming messages in Telegram groups for Ukrainian air alarms, extracting location data of UAVs, missiles, and planes. Adds a red marker to the map in QGIS, which turns white after some time and eventually disappears.
